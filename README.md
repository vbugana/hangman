# Hangman

Select a letter to figure out a hidden word in a set amount of chances build-in SVG image.

## Description

This is a JavaScript code that implements a simple hangman game. 

The game randomly selects a word from an array of words, and the player must guess the word by typing letters on the keyboard.

If the player types a correct letter, it is added to the word display, and if the player types a wrong letter, it is added to the list of wrong letters and a part of the hangman is drawn.

If the player guesses the word, a message is displayed congratulating the player, and if the player makes too many wrong guesses, a message is displayed telling the player they lost. 

The code also includes a function to restart the game.

Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.
